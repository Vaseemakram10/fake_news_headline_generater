## what we are building in this project ?
* We are building the fake news using the least of words.
* Then combine them and make them one sentence to get a meaningful sentence that is funny and fake news

## how we are building this project ?
*  first we are creating 3 to 4 list of word.
   + subjects < how / what
   + actions < where / what / with
   + places or objects

* we are picking the words from the these three list suming up the word to make a sentence for the fake news generater

## what are things wew are uing in the project?

concept || what it means in this project
* list || to store groups of the words like name, actions, and places

* random.choice() || to pick one item randomly from a list

* print() || to show the fake headline on screen

* while loop || to repeat the process until the user says "no"

* string concatenation or f-string || to from a sentence using selected words

## step to code this program and projecct

* step 1: import the random module
* step 2: create lists of sublects, actions, and plesce - all with indian exaples
* step 3: Use random.choice() t opick one word from each list
* step 4: Combine the words in to a headline using string fromings
* step 5: print the headline if they want another
* step  6: ask the user if they want another headline on not
* step 7: idf yes, repeat; if no, stop the program

#  future work
## * user input
## * catagory of news
## * to save the file of txt

# Psudo code
1. START the program
2. IMPORT the 'random' module
3. CREATE a list of Indian subjects
